Day 1
1. Refer to "Installation Instructions" from day1-data\day1_help & complete the same.

2. MUST go through "day1-data\day1_help\day1_sequence.rtf" and  from day1-data\day1_help\ & day1-data\day1_help\slides\PPTDay1.pdf
(only till whatever  we have covered)

3. Go through  code samples from day1-data\code\src

4. Solve (Hands on)
4.0
Accept 5 doubles from user (scanner)
Print it's average.

After creating PrintAverage.java (under day1_lab\src)
Open cmd prompt from the same src folder
To compile
javac -d ..\bin PrintAverage.java
cd ..\bin
To run 
java PrintAverage


4.1 Write Java program - 
Display food menu to user. User will select items from menu along with the quantity. (eg 1. Dosa 2. Samosa 3. Idli ... 0 . Generate Bill ) Assign fixed prices to food items(hard code the prices)
When user enters 'Generate Bill' option(0) , display total bill & exit.

OR
Write Java program for the following - 
It should  run till user enters any other option than add or sub or multiply or divide
Prompt user to enter the input operation : (add|subtract|multiply|divide) & 2 numbers(double)
Display the result of the operation.
Use Scanner for accepting all inputs from user. 
Hint : use switch-case

5. Reading home work 
Please read
day1-data\day1_help\readmes\java operators.txt


Day 2

1. MUST revise from today's sequence ("day2-data\day2_help\day2-sequence.rtf") n
refer : day2-data\code
1.1 Revise :  mem pics for Java data areas(stack,heap,method area),
1.2 Garbage collection introduction

1.3 
 Solve this (Discuss memory picture)
Given : Box class is compiled.
In main method  of TestBox
Box b1=new Box(1,2,3);
b1++;
Box b2=b1;
b1=new Box(3,4,5);
//any objects marked for garbage collection ? how many ? 
Box b3=b1;
b2=new Box(4,5,6);
//any objects marked for garbage collection ? how many ?

1.4 For additional practice -
Solve TestBox2.java


2. Solve Tank assignment along with memory picture.

What will be the output ?

class Tank {
  private int level;
  Tank(int l)
   {
     level=l;
   }
  public void setLevel(int level1)
  {
    level=level1;
  }
  public int getLevel()
  {
    return level;
  }
}	

public class Assignment {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Tank t1 = new Tank(10);
    Tank t2 = new Tank(20);
     s.o.p("1: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t1 = t2;//1st tank obj is marked GC
    s.o.p("2: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t1.setLevel(27);
     s.o.p("3: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t2.setLevel(t1.getLevel()+10);
     s.o.p("4: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
  }
}
Are there any objects marked for GC ?

3. What will happen (solve ready code samples : along with mem pics )
day2-data\day2_help\params_passing
3.1 TestParamPassing1.java
3.2 TestParamPassing2.java

4. Hands on

Create a  class Point2D   for representing a point in x-y co-ordinate system.
(Tight encapsulation please !)

4.1 Create a parameterized constructor to accept x & y co-ords.

4.2 Add  show() method  --to return point's x & y co-ords
String show() {
 return "(x,y)" +x+" "+y;
}


4.3 
Add a non static  , isEqual method to Point2D class : boolean returning method : must return true if both points are having same x,y co-ords or false otherwise.
Hint - Ask yourself - 
How will you invoke it from the tester ?

4.4 
Add a non static method , calculateDistance , to calc distance between 2 points
Hint : use distance formula.


eg : In Tester :
double distance=p1.calculateDistance(p2);

Hint - Ask yourself - 
How will you invoke it from the tester ?



4.5  Create a separate Driver(main)  class(for UI )  , "TestPoint" , with main(..)

4.6  Accept x,y co-ordinates for 2 points n store the co-ordinates
4.7  Display x,y co-ordinates of both of the points plotted  (using show() method)
Point2D p1=new Point2D(sc.nextInt(),sc.nextInt());
Point2D p2=new Point2D(sc.nextInt(),sc.nextInt());
sop(p1.show());
sop(p2.show());


4.8  (Optional work)
Find out if the points  are same or different (Hint : isEqual)
Print the message accordingly. (print SAME or DIFFERENT)




If points are not same , display distance between these 2 points.




Day 3
1. Complete Pending work.

2. Refer to today's sequence - 
"day3-data\day3_help\day3-sequence.rtf"

3. Refer to  <day3> , to revise 
access specifiers , packages n classpath 

4. Modify yesterday's Point2D's assignment (This has to be done w/o IDE)
Re factor (modify) n add Point2D class under the package - com.developers.geometry
Add TestPoint class under the package - com.tester
Make necessary changes .
Ensure that user should be able to run com.tester.TestPoint class from anywhere.
Hint - set CLASSPATH


5. Start the IDE (STS 3.9.18 : Eclipse IDE with Spring plug in)
Create a new workspace for core java.
Import day3_ide , in your workspace
Revise : arrays of primitive type n array of references
for-each loop
for vs for-each loop

6. 
 Discuss - 
== vs isEqual
using Point2D scenario

7. param passing 

8. Constructor chaining

9. Add a method to Point2D class , to create new point offset from the specified point.
