•	Use MySQL Relational Database to save resource.
•	Create Payload will have fields like – Vname, Company, Vnumber, Vtype, Uid, puchaseDate
•	“Id (auto generated)” will be populated by the Hibernate
•	There should be Validation on Create Payload. For example: 
1)	Vname, Vtype should not be blank.
2)	Vnumber should not be blank and length must be 10
3)	If User does not exist then Vehicle must not be registered under that user (display relevant message).
4)	None of the fields in Vehicle table are Nullable.
•	Rest URL should be named as per REST best practices.
•	Response codes should be as per REST guidelines (201 for resource creation, 404 for not found, 200 for ok, 400 for Bad request)
•	Error handling in case of failures. (Optional : Global Exception Handling)

Note:- You have to call all API's on Postman or Swagger
