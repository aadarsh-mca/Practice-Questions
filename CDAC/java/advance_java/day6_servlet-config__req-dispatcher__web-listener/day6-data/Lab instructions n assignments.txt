String modifyFlightDetails(flight id , no of stops , arrival time)throws SQLException
DAO Impl class
fields - cn , pst1, pst2
ctor - open cn , create pst1,pst2
clean up - close psts n cn
CRUD method - set IN params , exec update -> update count -> chk it with 1 -> ret mesg
Tester dao instance , dao clean up , call DAO' method

2.3 
Delete flight details by airline n route(source n destination)

Table - flights
POJO - Flight
DBUtils - copy
DAO i/f
String deleteFlightRoutes(airline , source , destination)throws SQLException
DAO Impl class
fields - cn , pst1, pst2,pst3
ctor - open cn , create pst1:select,pst2:update,pst3: delete query
clean up - close psts n cn
CRUD method - set IN params , exec update -> update count ->  ret mesg , saying how many routes are cancelled

Tester dao instance , dao clean up , call DAO' method

Day 2 (evening)

1. Add Apache Tomcat web server (9.0.88) in the new workspace (created for web java)
Refer - "day2_eve_data\day2_help\Development Steps.txt"

2. Create dynamic web project 
eg - test_web

3. Add index.html under <src>/<main>/<webapp> folder

4. Run web appliction on the server n test the response on external brwoser
(chrome | edge)

5. Complete pending JDBC tasks

6. Refer to stored function 
Refer - "day1-data\help\jdbc help\sql\sql cmds.txt" to add "accounts" table DDL n copy stored function.
Execute it from JDBC application with layers
Tester - DAO - POJO - DBUtils - DB


Day 3 (morning)

1. Create dynamic web project (day3_lab) . Test it with HTML(index.html) contents.
2. Create n deploy the servlet using annotation.
(Understand annotation)
3. Create n deploy the servlet using xml tags
4.  Create 1 servlet with default (lazy) loading n another one with eager loading.
Compare these two.

5. Servlet JDBC integration
(Objective - User signin)

Day 3 (evening)

1. import day3_voting in your workspace (same as you were importing core java projects)
Trace n revise (code walk through) , entire request -resp flow .

2. Mandatory Hands on

2.1 Create new dynamic web project
- day3_flghts
2.2 Add welcome file
- choose_fligts.html
- Add HTML form with 3 inputs
-source(text) , destination(text) , departure date (date)

2.3. Submit the form to the Servlet
- ShowAvailableFlights (servlet)
- perform JDBC integration , get list of available flights n send this list to the web client.


Day 4

NO new assignments !
1. Complete pending work , as much as possible .

2. import day4_voting 
Do code walk through along with readmes , diagrams n Java EE docs

Important readmes n diagrams

"day4-data\day4_help\page navigation\page navigation techniques.txt"
"day4-data\day4_help\page navigation\page navigation summary.png"
"day4-data\day4_help\server side state management techniques\regarding session tracking.txt"
"day4-data\day4_help\server side state management techniques\cookie.png"


Day 5 
1. import day5_voting in your workspace.
1.1 Trace entire voter's flow with HttpSession based session tracking, from login -logout.

2. NOTE 
The help files are already shared under day4-data

2.1 Revise - HttpSession API 
Refer to - 
"day4-data\day4_help\server side state management techniques\regarding session tracking.txt" 

3. Mandatory Hands on
3.1 Try to develop complete voter flow - on your own.

OR

3.2 Try to complete the admin flow of voting case study
Refer - "case studies\voting assignment.png"

OR (Best possible option to understand Servlets completely)
Complete flight reservation 
Refer 
"case studies\Simple Flight Reservation.png"
 

Day 6
1. import day6.1 , to revise
- Creation of web app , in DB independent manner , using ServletConfig
- Refer to web.xml , LoginServlet
- "day6_help\readmes\regarding servletconfig.txt"

2. import day6.2 , to revise
- Creation of web app , in DB independent manner , using ServletContext
- Refer to web.xml , LoginServlet
- "day6_help\readmes\regarding servletcontext.txt"

3. import day6.3 , to revise
- server pull (request dispatching) - forward technique

4. import day6.4 , to revise
- server pull (request dispatching) - include technique

5. import day6.5 , to revise
- web application listeners

6. Mandatory Hands on -
Create new dyn web application
6.1 welcome page - operations.html
inputs - 2 numbers(double) n drop down list for arithmetic ops - add | subtract | multiply | divide

6.2 Submit the form to -
ProcessForm page 
Compute the operation on the numbers, forward client to results page (another servlet) n display result from there.

OR 
slightly better work -
Accept - src a/c no , dest a/c no n transfer amount from user in the form
Submit the form to ProcessFormServlet
Use BankAccount DAO - call a stored procedure
Forward client to results page , to display
- updated src n dest balance to the web client.

Try once with forward n then with include , to understand  forward vs include.

7. Completely OPTIONAL but interesting work !!!
- Display no of currently logged in users.
Hint - web app listener.
