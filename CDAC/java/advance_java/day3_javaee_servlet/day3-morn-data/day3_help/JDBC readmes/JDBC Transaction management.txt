DB Transactions 
What is it ?
Functionally grouped SQL statements , representing a Business logic.
Tx => all the statements from a Tx either fail or succeed.
i.e If any statement fails : entire Tx has to be discarded. 
The changes made by the Tx will be made permanent : if n only if all the statements succeed.

eg : Purchase a product
Involves 1. Checking availability of the product
2. Customer credit/debit limit & updating the same
3. Updating stock .
If any of the above mentioned steps fail , entire transaction need to be discarded.

How to do it from JDBC API?

1. Start a Tx
Connection i/f method 
void setAutoCommit(boolean flag)
ie. unset the auto-commit flag.
eg : cn.setAutoCommit(false);

2. Wrap entire Tx within a separate try-catch block.

3. If the entire try block succeds (i.e at the end of try) ---> commit the Tx
API : cn.commit();
4.But if u reach inside the catch clause(due to system exc or custom exc) : rollback the Tx
API : cn.rollback();
5. To continue : set auto-commit to true again.

6. To rollback a transaction partially , there exists additional method for setting save points.
Connection i/f method
public Savepoint setSavepoint() throws SQLException

7. How to restore the DB state to a savepoint ?
Connection i/f method
void rollback(Savepoint savepoint) throws SQLException
Cancels all changes made after the given Savepoint object was set.
