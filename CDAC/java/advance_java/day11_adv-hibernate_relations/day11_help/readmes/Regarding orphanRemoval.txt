Regarding orphanRemoval

What is orphanRemoval ?

It is an attribute used to specify whether or not to remove entities that are no longer referenced by their parent entity (i.e orphan entities)

 It's commonly used in the context of a one-to-many or many-to-one relationship, where the child entity is removed when it is no longer associated with the parent.

Its a  boolean property of @OneToMany n @OneToOne annotation.
default value - false

It states - 
Whether to apply the remove operation to entities that have been removed from the relationship and to cascade the remove operation to those entities.
We had already added - cascade=CascadeType.ALL (which includes - REMOVE)
BUT still it wasn't working.

So after enabling the orphanRemoval=true , after removing the product from the category 
(using removeProduct) , we are telling hibernate to remove the orphan product record .
